- [] Create a new organization on Github for the developers' group
- [] Create the main repo on Github as the front page of the organization (using also Github pages)
- [] Find a location
- [] Find a way to organize meetups with members (excluding the MeetUp platform)
- [] Find sponsors for meetups expenses (location rent, drink&food, gadgets and merchandising)
- [] Create a developers network to spread the word and promoting the initiative (Linkedin, people, existing groups, mailing lists, etc)
- [] Create a Slack and/or Telegram channel(s)
- [] Schedule a welcome meetup
